# Approximate nearest neighbor

Golang implementation of approximate nearest neighbor based on navigable small world graphs [1] Checkout presentation for detailed explanation on use-cases and perfomance.

[1]Y. Malkov, A. Ponomarenko, A. Logvinov, and V. Krylov, ‘Approximate nearest neighbor algorithm based on navigable small world graphs’, Information Systems, vol. 45, pp. 61–68, 2014.

Features:
  - Approximate k-NN Search
  - Different distance metrics
  - Loading and saving graph to disk from memory



# Dataset

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bricevergnou/spotify-recommendation (https://github.com/Brice-Vergnou/spotify_recommendation/blob/master/data/data.csv)

Offers a nice data set which contains n=200, 14 dimensional points. 

## Delivery plan

### Lab 4

- [x] Basic interfaces
- [x] Add more unit tests
